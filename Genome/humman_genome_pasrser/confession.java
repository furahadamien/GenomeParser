	 * however  the helper method that i developed to check if a sequence is a multiple of 3 works well.
	 * i couldn't figure out what error i made in calling the helper method.
	 * this behavior affects the the find gene method since i call isGene to help me validate is a string is indeed a gene. otherwise the rest works fine i believe*/
